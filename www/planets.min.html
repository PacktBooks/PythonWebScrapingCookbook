Other civilizations also named this planet from this attribute; for example, the Egyptians named it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one."</td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars">Wikipedia</a></td></tr><tr id="planet5" class="planet" name="Jupiter"><td><img src="img/jupiter-150x150.png"></td><td>Jupiter</td><td>1898</td><td>142984</td><td>The largest and most massive of the planets was named Zeus by the Greeks and Jupiter by the Romans; he was the most important deity in both pantheons.</td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter">Wikipedia</a></td></tr><tr id="planet6" class="planet" name="Saturn"><td><img src="img/saturn-150x150.png"></td><td>Saturn</td><td>568</td><td>120536</td><td>Roman name for the Greek Cronos, father of Zeus/Jupiter. Other civilizations have given different names to Saturn, which is the farthest planet from Earth that can be observed by the naked human eye. Most of its satellites were named for Titans who, according to Greek mythology, were brothers and sisters of Saturn.</td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn">Wikipedia</a></td></tr><tr id="planet7" class="planet" name="Uranus"><td><img src="img/uranus-150x150.png"></td><td>Uranus</td><td>86.8</td><td>51118</td><td>Several astronomers, including Flamsteed and Le Monnier, had observed Uranus earlier but had recorded it as a fixed star. Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery "Georgian Sidus" after George III; the planet was named by Johann Bode in 1781 after the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus, the father of Kronos (Saturn) and grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter).</td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus">Wikipedia</a></td></tr><tr id="planet8" class="planet" name="Neptune"><td><img src="img/neptune-150x150.png"></td><td>Neptune</td><td>102</td><td>49528</td><td>Neptune was "predicted" by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier who, independently, were able to account for the irregularities in the motion of Uranus by correctly predicting the orbital elements of a trans- Uranian body. Using the predicted parameters of Le Verrier (Adams never published his predictions), Johann Galle observed the planet in 1846. Galle wanted to name the planet for Le Verrier, but that was not acceptable to the international astronomical community. Instead, this planet is named for the Roman god of the sea.</td><td><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune">Wikipedia</a></td></tr><tr id="planet9" class="planet" name="Pluto"><td><img src="img/pluto-150x150.png"></td><td>Pluto</td><td>0.0146</td><td>2370</td><td>Pluto was discovered at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, AZ during a systematic search for a trans-Neptune planet predicted by Percival Lowell and William H. Pickering.
